All the excel files here (except RelativeFrequency) were originally outputted as csv files and are now saved here as xlsx files. (All data is the same).

Note: I had some trouble with the graph smoother which is why it is only generated from x = -10 to x = 10. I hope that this isn't too big of an issue.
